# channelizer-discord-bot
During these **WFH** (Work From Home) times, Discord helps to collaborate and execute projects with fellow mates. Hence private channels became a necessity for working on different projects in a server with other people. The process of setting up permissions and creating roles for the same proved too hectic for me to not automate. Thus, became **Channelizer**. 

Gone are the days of creating private roles, numerous text and voice channels and setting up permissions for them, **Channelizer** does it all for you.

**Updates:**
1.  Make Movie Night embeds with only 5 arguments.
2. Get **Top 5** (can be changed from source code) movie recommendations from IMDb, user gives genre (which are present in IMDb) in argument.
